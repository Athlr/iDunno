Monday May 8th
   Met with my group, Aaron, Justin, and Luis. Got to know each other a bit and began brainstorming some ideas.


Tuseday May 9th
   Decided on a project idea and them. 
   We looked around for similar apps to draw some inspiration.

Wednessday May 10th
   We began drawing out our wireframe. 
   Honestly, I didn't think this would be helpful, but having a rough sketch of the site
   has made conceptualizing it easier.

Thursday May 11th
   We met with our Rosheen. She seem to like our idea, but said it looked a little light.
   We hit the drawing board. We stuck with the spinner idea, but returned to a previous idea
   to have a social aspect to the project. 

   Ultimately, we thought it would be a good idea to have a friends list and allow others to spin
   with their restaurants since our issue affects groups of people.

Friday May 12th

    I wasn't feeling well today. I had to leave early. Looking at the slack a few hours later
    it looks like my team settled on the MVP and submitted it.

Monday May 15th

  Having an idea about what we need, we drew out the endpoints that we were likely to need. I felt a little overwhelmed since Id already repeated Mod 2 and I wasn't sure if could repeat Mod 3 in the event of something crazy. Once I found out that I could, I felt instantly better. Obviously that's NOT the plan, but the safety net takes a load off my shoulders.

   Today we stated working on the tables. Where I missed Friday, my team caught me up on the installation and use for BeeKeeper. I did start to get a little frustrated during the CS presentation. I appreciate the CS team a TREMENDOUS amount, but I always feel like it is a dead stop to the project work. 


Wednessday May 17th
   Today started the Data structure lessons. To say that I'm riding the struggle buss to confustion town, while humourous, is accurate. I can tell this is going to be what we are graded on for the final in the written portions.

Thursday May 18th
   We spent most of the day trying to get the workflow setup on gitlab. While I'm still not really sure on the difference between issue, feature, user story, and what-not... it is there and we can work on it.

Friday May 19th
   Not a lot to say today. We started trying to get Auth to work on the back-end so that a new user could be created with a Hashed password. 

Monday May 22nd
   Just sort of grinding away today. We started making out end points and trying to get them to display/work in swagger. I have to say, having it built in with FastAPI is pretty awesome. Pydantic is pretty cool too. If I had had this in Mod 2 I don't think I would have had to repeat Mod 2.

Tuesday May 23rd
   Honestly, I'm a little lost on this front end Auth. Getting the token then using its existance across all the pages seems super cool though. I think Aaron and I are going to tackle it.

Wednessday May 24th
   After some talking last night after class, Aaron and I got it working to a point and I make a basic login/out page. I'm not saying I'm super proud of me for discovering how to make it use just one file with a series of if statements and a inline html/css sytanx of <? :> to look and see if the token is present, but I might have a big ole smile.

   That gif pretty much sums up my attempts to make a spinner. Things are moving. Things are spinning. Is it meaningful? NO. No it is not.

Friday May 26th
   Honestly not feeling well today. My Wife and I have called it Phone it in Phriday. It is unfortunate since today is the social hack hour. But It is nice to see some of my cohort leads from before I had to repeat.

Monday May 29th
   Started work on my wheel for the main page, before the user is logged in. Had the idea that I could just make a new endpoint that made a call to the restaurants table, but only returned the restaurants that have a suggested property of true. I worked out, but now I'm just trying to get this Carousel to behave in a way that isn't how it was intended.

   Here's a funny gif of my trying to stop my spinner, but the start/stop button is attached and also spinning... So enjoy my struggle to turn it off:

   So, I got the spinner spinning, it is time to get the filter modal working. I've taken a look at the tailwind and headless UI documentation. My team has been doing more with the front end design and has helped catch me up. I think the best approch for this is going to be breaking it down into tiny parts or I'll get lost in the minutia of the process.

Wednessday May 31st
   I would be lying if I said I gave 100% of my attention to the CI/CD lecture. It is sort of a nebulous thing in the distance at the moment. I am SUPER happy that this is recorded. 

Thursday June 1st
   I wasn't feeling well this day. I hadn't been sleeping well with the stress. Then I turned in a token to get some sleep... which caused me to feel guilty for using the toke. One-thought-lead-to-another and my axiety got the better of me and I missed the whole day. I was able to get everything to main that I was working on and communicate to my team that I would be out, but they had everything I had been working on.

Friday June 2nd
   Back and ready to work. After listening to lecture and the preassure really starting, we've decided to look at my spinner and make sure we have EVERYTHING I could possibly need before start working on the Back-end deployment. 

BONUS CONTENT: Saturday June 3rd:
   I wasn't able to sleep. I got up at around 6am after going to bed at around 4 am working on my spinner. I worked for about an hour, but I got the radio buttons for our cuisine list into two column AND I got the friends modal INSIDE the filtering modal to work. Back to bed.

BONUS CONTENT: Sunday June 4th:
   With the projec due in five days, I'm spending all Sunday to get my spinner completely finished in terms of functionality. 

   Update: I wasn't able to completely finish, but with 15 hours of time in, I'm able to get all of the data we need from the filter. I just need to get friends data and the user data... mush'em together, then filter them... but that's tomorrow Matt's problem. 

Monday June 5th
   Well, it's the last week. Rubber hittin' the road. Going to get this data normalized and the filter working and displaying the winner.

Tuseday June 6th
   We have completed functionality. And through Aaron's efforts, the deployment is "Completed". That is to say the front-end is working, but the back-end is just a white page still. This appears to be on Galvanize's side. Here's hopin' it is fixed by tomorrow.

Wednessday June 7th
   Galvanize pushed out a fix and now our Depoyment is DONE! Time to debugg.

   Update: SOOOOO... many buggs. We've cleared a lot, but ESLint is the worst.

Thursday June 8th 
   Final walk through and prep for the presentation. Here's hopin'!!!
